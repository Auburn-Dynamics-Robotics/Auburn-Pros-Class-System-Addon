- Added support for multiple orientations of inertia sensor. Forward/Backwards, Left/Right,
  and Up/Down axis must be declared when initializing a Base with an Inertia Sensor.
  If an invalid axis is provided then the Base will go to the defaults below:
  - Forward/Backward Axis: Z_AXIS
  - Left/Right Axis: X_AXIS
  - Up/Down Axis: Y_AXIS
- Began developing Gyroscopic turning.


2/28/20
- Developed Theoretical inertia-based base movement code
- Added "TYPES.h" file which contains natural language variables for integers
  - Directions
    - FORWARD = 1
    - BACKWARD = 2
    - RIGHT = 3
    - LEFT = 4
  - Distance Type
    - INERTIA = 1
    - ENCODER = 2
  -
- Consolidated public base class methods into one overloaded method
  - move(int direction, int rpm)
  - move(int type, int direction, int distance, int units, int rpm)
