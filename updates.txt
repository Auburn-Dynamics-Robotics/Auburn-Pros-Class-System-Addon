- Developed Theoretical inertia-based base movement code
- Added "TYPES.h" file which contains natural language variables for integers
  - Directions
    - FORWARD = 1
    - BACKWARD = 2
    - RIGHT = 3
    - LEFT = 4
  - Distance Type
    - INERTIA = 1
    - ENCODER = 2
  -
- Consolidated public base class methods into one overloaded method
  - move(int direction, int rpm)
  - move(int type, int direction, int distance, int units, int rpm)
